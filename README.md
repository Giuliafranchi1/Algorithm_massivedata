# Project for the course of Algorithms for Massive Data 2022-2023

I developed a project for Algorithms for Massive Data course using Convolutional Neural Networks for classifying images of plants leaves belonging to 12 different classes of species.

The coding part was entirely done on jupiter notebook using Google Colab platform.
